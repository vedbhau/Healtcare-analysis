## 📖 Overview

This project demonstrates how to leverage Power BI's data visualization tools to extract and showcase insights from medical datasets. By creating interactive dashboards, it empowers healthcare providers and decision-makers to analyze data trends, manage resources effectively, and enhance patient care quality.

## 🔍 Key Findings

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Patient Demographics
- **Total Patient Count**: Displayed using a card visual.
- **Age Group Distribution**: Visualized via a donut chart.
- **Gender Breakdown**: Showcased with card visuals for male and female counts.
- **Gender Percentage Distribution**: Calculated and displayed in card visuals.

### 🏥 Patient Stay Duration
- **Average ICU Stay**: Illustrated using a gauge visual.
- **Average Hospital Stay**: Calculated and presented in another gauge visual.

### 🔗 Risk Factors and Disease Correlations
- **Alcohol Consumption and Disease**: Analyzed correlations with lung disease, blood clots, blood pressure, and blood sugar issues using a decomposition tree.
- **Smoking and Disease Correlation**: Explored correlations with various diseases using a decomposition tree.

---

## 🖥️ Interactive Dashboards

The dashboards include features that allow users to:

- **Filter and Segment Data**: Use slicers to segment data by location (rural/urban), gender, and admission type (emergency/outpatient).
- **Analyze Trends Over Time**: Track patient counts by year and week using a matrix visual for time-based insights.

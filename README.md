Healthcare Data Analysis with Power BI

Overview

This repository contains a Power BI project designed to uncover valuable insights from raw medical data. By leveraging Power BI's data visualization capabilities, we've created interactive dashboards to enhance decision-making and improve healthcare operations.

Key Findings

Patient Demographics:

Visualized the total number of patients using a card visual.
Showcased the age group distribution of patients using a donut chart.
Identified the gender breakdown (male and female counts) using card visuals.
Calculated the percentage distribution of males and females using card visuals.
Patient Stay Duration:

Determined the average duration of intensive care unit stays using a gauge visual.
Calculated the overall average duration of hospital stays using a gauge visual.
Risk Factors and Disease Correlations:

Analyzed the prevalence of alcohol consumption in various diseases (lungs, blood clots, BP, sugar) using a decomposition tree.
Identified the correlation between smoking and various diseases using a decomposition tree.
Interactive Dashboards

The project includes interactive dashboards that allow users to:

Filter and Segment Data: Utilize slicers to partition data by rural/urban areas, gender, and admission type (emergency/outpatient).
Explore Trends Over Time: Analyze patient counts by year and week using a matrix visual.
How to Use
